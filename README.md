# Learning-Analytics-Based-Project-
# Project Overview
  **Student Enrollment and Performance Analysis**
  This project is aim to analyse student performance and enrolment.  We have collected raw data from students based on their previous grades. The project has two parts, one is system will classify Grades into two catageories Good or Bad using Sciket learn with the help of Machine learning techniques, and in second part we visualize the pre-processed data using D3.js.
